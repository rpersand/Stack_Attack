# Stack_Attack

An educational first-person shooter game made using Unity and C#. The main objective of this game is to survive the zombie stack horde and move on to the next level. Each level in the game represents an individual week at Fullstack Academy. The game is designed where each level contains topics that students had to learn during that particular week at Fullstack Academy and overcome in order to move on to the next week (e.g level one contains Javascript, HTML, and CSS enemies which were the topics covered during week one).

Instructions on how to play the game: Drag and drop the index.html file into firefox to launch the Web GL built game.
